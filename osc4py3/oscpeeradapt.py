"""Tools to manage high level communications between systems using OSC.

The high level packet management encoding/decoding (with support for
addrpattern compression/decompression, for checksum, authentication and
encryption) is already in oscbuildparse.

Low-level raw packets transport (read/write with devices or network) is
realized with objects of subclasses of :class:`OSCChannel`. We call these
objects readers and writers.
Readers identify OSC raw packets (datagram or stream based packet control),
source (who send the data) and store them in a received_rawpackets global
queue (defined in oscreadwrite module).
This allow readers to have different read policy (poll, thread, etc)
disconnected from our upper layer management of received data.

This module organize communications on the upper level, receiving and sending
packets from/to different OSC systems. It allows to identify systems (for
the supported communication options listed before) and have specific
processing for some messages (ex. authenticate packets, negociate addrpattern
compression by requesting string/int mapping, etc).
Finally, it call registered functions matching message address pattern.
