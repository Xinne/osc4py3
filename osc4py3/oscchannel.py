"""Base classe for OSC data transmission.

TransportChannel provides basic options common to communication.

TransportChannel subclasses are used for communication with peer OSC
systems. They wrap transmission of OSC packets via different ways.

A channel can be just a reader or just a writer (for packet based
communications like UDP or multicast), or both (for connected stream
based communications like TCP or serial USB).

#TODO: add slip2pacekt when writing  if necessary.

# To have a clean separation between channel readers and OSC management,
# we use an intermediate queue. It allow to have different policies
# for readers (ex. polling, own thread, global thread...) but same
# processing for message dispatching.
# Note: the queu manage concurrent access to storage.

# Note: I setup a Semaphore to support blocking threads on waiting for
# some packet availability in received_rawpackets queue (there is no wait
# method on deque). But it required Python3.2 for the Semaphore.wait timeout
# support, made the code unnecessarily less readable, and wasted some more
# time in system calls (TransportChannel.received_packet()+next_rawpacket cost
# twice).
# So I discard it.
# If necessary, next_rawpacket() callers should install a semi-active wait
# with frequent polling and some blocking with timeout.

        map action verbs to OSC messages or direct callable.

        OSC messages have the advantage to simply integrate inside the

        When using OSC messages, the action parameters must be basic
