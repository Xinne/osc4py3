"""Dispatching of messages among matching OSC methods.

The high level packet management encoding/decoding (with support for
addrpattern compression/decompression, for checksum, authentication and
encryption) is already in oscbuildparse.

Low-level raw packets transport (read/write with devices or network) is
realized with objects of subclasses of :class:`OSCChannel`. We call these
objects readers and writers.
Readers identify OSC raw packets (datagram or stream based packet control),
source (who send the data) and store them in a received_rawpackets global
queue (defined in oscreadwrite module).
This allow readers to have different read policy (poll, thread, etc)
disconnected from our upper layer management of received data.
