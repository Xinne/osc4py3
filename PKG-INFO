        .. note::
        
            Testers feedback welcome. This development was finally not tested in its
            initial planning, any problem / bug / info are welcome.
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        This module is an implementation of `Open Sound Control (OSC)`_ message
        transport protocol within a Python3 package.
        
        .. _Open Sound Control (OSC): http://opensoundcontrol.org/
        
        Manage different sides of OSC in possibly different contexts:
        
        - encoding/decoding of OSC message packets (including bundles)
        - routing of incoming messages based on selector regexps or globbing
        - timed messages with possible delay period
        - named client/server for sending/subscribing
        - different scheduling models (single process, totally multithread, only multithread for communications)
        - extra processing of packets (hack points to encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify…)
        
        Note: routing, timed messages, named client/server, scheduling models make a complex system
        (see the “big picture” in doc). The oscbuildparse module of osc4py3 package can be used as
        is and provides nice OSC packets encoding/decoding functions usable in your own message
        transmission scheme.
        
        
        
        Note: Version is set to 0.Xb but module is normally usable. I wait for some positive
        feedback (or at least not negative until few weeks) to go to version 1.0 production stable.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Unless someone built a package for your OS distro, the simplest procedure
        is to use ``pip`` to install the module:
        
            pip install osc4py3
        
        If you have no admin access to install things on you computer, you may install
        a virtualenv and run pip inside this virtual env, or you can do a local user
        installation:
        
            pip install --user osc4py3
